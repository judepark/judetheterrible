I learned the following from a 2018 entrepreneurship training session in Kingston, Ontario.

After a lecture training on time management, I was left feeling unsatisfied as to what constitutes a “good” time management. It seemed to matter individually for each person, and I wanted concrete techniques. How do I know what to do when I feel like I am drowning in so many lists of things to do?

The <strong>MC + MSN</strong> technique is a useful lens that gives clarity to your immediate actions during a chaotic situation. The stress from an overwhelming list of tasks we need to get done can strike in any moment in our lives, whether business or personal. Next time you are overwhelmed, this classifications may be useful for your next emergency:

<strong>MC + MSN</strong>

<strong>Mission Critical (MC):</strong> What is most crucially needed in this moment?

<strong>Must Have’s (M):</strong> What must be done in order to move forward?

<strong>Should Have’s (S):</strong> What should be done in order to improve the situation?

<strong>Nice to Have’s (N):</strong> What will be nice to have in the long run?

An example of this technique in action was when I received news of my mother’s stroke. She was in Seoul and I was in a lecture hall in Canada. I stepped out to hear the news on a phone call, and when I hung up I went numb.

I organized my thoughts in this extremely stressful situation and realized:

My Mission Critical (MC) in that moment was to remove myself from the lecture hall and be alone so I could process what I should do. I was seconds away from breaking down or crying — I was clearly not in a state to interact with anyone. I removed myself from my surrounding and found a private room. Once I recognized what my Mission Critical in that moment was, I was able to allow myself to think of next logical steps. 

My Must Have (M) was to purchase a plane ticket to Seoul. My Should Have (S) was to go back to my room and pack my things so that I could get to the airport as soon as I could. My Nice to Have (N) was to pack only what was necessary for my trip, and also to gain the emotional support necessary to mentally prepare myself for the journey ahead.

Having organized the MC+MSN principal I was able to organize my actions in sequence in order to carry myself forward, rather than becoming immobile. I removed myself from a room full of people that was distracting to me (MC). I remembered to bring my laptop with me to purchased the next ticket out to Seoul (M). I then went back to my room and began packing (S). While I packed my necessities, I called those who I trusted to have my back and knew how to help me calm down (N).

MC + MSN[^1] helps to categorize which requirements are necessary that rely on each other for it to be accomplished. It gives the opportunity to evaluate the gains and losses of each feature/step for the ideal outcome. The MoSCoW technique tackles the issue of prioritization — when stakeholder pressure or a personal tragedy strikes, simple techniques can save you trouble.

In moments of utter disorder — just remember Mariah Carey sitting on a computer using MSN. It might help you out.
