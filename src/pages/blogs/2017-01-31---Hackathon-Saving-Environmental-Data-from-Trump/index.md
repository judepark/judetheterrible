If it’s something against Trump, I’m in. 

As the End of Term 2016 Project organized by Internet Archive, my faculty at University of Toronto hosted a Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump at my very own library. Professor Matt Price from my faculty spearheaded this exciting event that started with free coffee and donuts (of course, of course). This huge hackathon had professionals and students from both in and out of University of Pennsylvania and University of Toronto. I even spoke to a retired veteran of IT who just felt like helping out. 

The hackathon was divided into various groups, all with the goal of archiving the federal online pages and data that are in danger of disappearing during the Trump administration. This event was focused on preserving information and data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which likely were to close down the minute Trump stepped into the White House. 

The linke to the github containing all the guidelines and codes and waysto help can be found here. 

Here was the breakdown of the activities from the hackathon, taken from the offical call to action posters: 

Activities: 
1. Identifying endangered programs and data 
2. Seeding the End of Term webcrawler with priority URLs 
3. Identifying and mapping the location of inaccessible environmental databases 
4. Hacking scripts to make accessible to the webcrawler hard to reach databases. 
5. Building a toolkit so that other groups can hold similar events 

I chose the group that were working on hackers who could figure out how to extract data and URLs from databases. It was both fun and kind of moving, seeing this solidarity among this fantastic group of skilled professionals. Also, having my friends to joke around with when we got stuck on some code issues were also fun. 

I was also suprised to find a bunch of journalist at the event. One of them tried to interview me, but I was too busy stuffing pizza down my grad-student-scavaging-for-free-food-mouth, haha. I even heard a late night talk show host mentioned the event? Pretty exciting.
