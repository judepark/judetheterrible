For anyone who wants a longer introduction (bless you): 

##Who are you?
I am an interaction designer in pursuit of fairness. I have 3 years of experience conducting UX research and design under my belt. I completed a masters (*UX Design* and *Information Systems Design*), and a bachelors (*Anthropology*, *Linguistics* and *History*). As a designer I create fair products and services that do not hinder the user by eliminating mismatches between the user and the system.

##Why did you become a designer?
Growing up, I was always in pursuit of doing something creative. Whether that was being in ballet or publishing or working as a librarian. I learned through [trial and error](http://localhost:8000/trial_and_error "Trial and Error: How I Became an Interaction Designer") how difficult it can be to find a trajectory that you enjoy, are good at, and feel a sense of belonging when doing it. Designing interactions is that trajectory for me.

##What is your research/design process?
I take a user-centric approach to my design process, where the user acts as my axis. 

I leverage my communication skills to collect dependable data. You can check out my research process here.

## Which area of design are you most interested in?
What interests me as a designer is understanding how applications can hinder users, based on harmful or discriminatory design practices. Pursuing fair access to products through design is what makes me get up in the morning. We are in constant catch-up mode to all the breaches in security and biases in ethics of our technological innovations. Design is a cost-effective, safeguard instrument we have at our disposal that can bring about balance to this disorder.

## What do you do in your free time?
Mostly I like to read books or work on my projects while listening to music. I also like to draw comics. If my schedule permits I become a swimmer, dancer and practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
